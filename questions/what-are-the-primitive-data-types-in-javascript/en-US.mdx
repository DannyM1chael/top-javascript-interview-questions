title: What are the primitive data types in JavaScript?
---

## TL;DR

JavaScript has seven primitive data types: `string`, `number`, `boolean`, `null`, `undefined`, `symbol`, and `bigint`. These types are immutable and are not objects. They represent the most basic forms of data in JavaScript.

## Primitive data types in JavaScript

### String

A `string` represents a sequence of characters used to represent text. Strings are created by enclosing characters in single quotes (`'`), double quotes (`"`), or backticks (`` ` ``).

```js
let name = 'John';
let greeting = 'Hello, world!';
let templateLiteral = `This is a template literal`;
```

### Number

A `number` represents both integer and floating-point numbers. JavaScript does not differentiate between the two.

```js
let integer = 42;
let float = 3.14;
```

### Boolean

A `boolean` represents a logical entity and can have only two values: `true` or `false`.

```js
let isJavaScriptFun = true;
let isTired = false;
```

### Null

`null` is a special value that represents the intentional absence of any object value. It is often used to indicate that a variable should be empty.

```js
let emptyValue = null;
```

### Undefined

`undefined` indicates that a variable has been declared but has not yet been assigned a value.

```js
let notAssigned;
console.log(notAssigned); // undefined
```

### Symbol

A `symbol` is a unique and immutable primitive value and may be used as the key of an object property. Symbols are created using the `Symbol()` function.

```js
let uniqueId = Symbol('id');
```

### BigInt

A `bigint` is a numeric data type that can represent integers with arbitrary precision. BigInts are created by appending `n` to the end of an integer or by using the `BigInt()` function.

```js
let bigNumber = 1234567890123456789012345678901234567890n;
let anotherBigNumber = BigInt(1234567890123456789012345678901234567890);
```
