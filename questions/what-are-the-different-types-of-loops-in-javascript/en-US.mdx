title: What are the different types of loops in JavaScript?
---

## TL;DR

In JavaScript, there are several types of loops used to iterate over data structures or execute a block of code multiple times. The main types are `for`, `while`, `do...while`, `for...in`, and `for...of`. Each loop has its specific use case. For example, `for` loops are great for iterating a known number of times, while `for...of` is useful for iterating over iterable objects like arrays.

## Different types of loops in JavaScript

### For loop

The `for` loop is used when the number of iterations is known beforehand. It consists of three parts: initialization, condition, and increment/decrement.

```javascript
for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
  console.log(i);
}
```

### While loop

The `while` loop continues to execute as long as the specified condition is `true`. It is useful when the number of iterations is not known.

```javascript
let i = 0;
while (i < 5) {
  console.log(i);
  i++;
}
```

### Do...while loop

The `do...while` loop is similar to the `while` loop, but it guarantees that the code block will be executed at least once.

```javascript
let i = 0;
do {
  console.log(i);
  i++;
} while (i < 5);
```

### For...in loop

The `for...in` loop is used to iterate over the enumerable properties of an object. It is not recommended for arrays due to potential issues with inherited properties.

```javascript
const obj = { a: 1, b: 2, c: 3 };
for (let key in obj) {
  console.log(key, obj[key]);
}
```

### For...of loop

The `for...of` loop is used to iterate over iterable objects like arrays, strings, and NodeLists. It is more suitable for arrays compared to `for...in`.

```javascript
const arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
for (let value of arr) {
  console.log(value);
}
```
