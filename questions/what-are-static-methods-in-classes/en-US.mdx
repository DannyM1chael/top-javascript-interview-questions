title: What are static methods in classes?
---

## TL;DR

Static methods in classes are methods that belong to the class itself rather than to instances of the class. They can be called without creating an instance of the class. You define a static method using the `static` keyword. For example:

```js
class MyClass {
  static myStaticMethod() {
    return 'Hello, World!';
  }
}

console.log(MyClass.myStaticMethod()); // Output: 'Hello, World!'
```

## What are static methods in classes?

### Definition

Static methods are methods that are defined on the class itself, not on instances of the class. They are called on the class directly and cannot access instance properties or methods.

### Syntax

To define a static method, use the `static` keyword before the method name:

```js
class MyClass {
  static myStaticMethod() {
    return 'Hello, World!';
  }
}
```

### Usage

Static methods are useful for utility functions, helper methods, or any functionality that does not require an instance of the class. They can be called directly on the class:

```js
console.log(MyClass.myStaticMethod()); // Output: 'Hello, World!'
```

### Accessing static methods

Static methods can only be accessed through the class itself, not through instances of the class:

```js
const myInstance = new MyClass();
console.log(myInstance.myStaticMethod()); // Error: myStaticMethod is not a function
```

### Example

Here is a more comprehensive example demonstrating the use of static methods:

```js
class MathUtils {
  static add(a, b) {
    return a + b;
  }

  static subtract(a, b) {
    return a - b;
  }
}

console.log(MathUtils.add(5, 3)); // Output: 8
console.log(MathUtils.subtract(5, 3)); // Output: 2
```

In this example, `add` and `subtract` are static methods that perform basic arithmetic operations. They can be called directly on the `MathUtils` class without creating an instance.
