title: What is the difference between `for...in` and `for...of` loops?
---

## TL;DR

`for...in` loops iterate over the enumerable properties of an object, including inherited properties. It is best used for objects. `for...of` loops iterate over the values of an iterable object like arrays, strings, or NodeLists. It is best used for arrays and other iterable collections.

```js
// for...in example
const obj = { a: 1, b: 2, c: 3 };
for (let key in obj) {
  console.log(key); // logs "a", "b", "c"
}

// for...of example
const arr = [1, 2, 3];
for (let value of arr) {
  console.log(value); // logs 1, 2, 3
}
```

## Difference between `for...in` and `for...of` loops

### `for...in` loop

The `for...in` loop is used to iterate over the enumerable properties of an object. It iterates over the keys (property names) of the object.

```js
const obj = { a: 1, b: 2, c: 3 };
for (let key in obj) {
  console.log(key); // logs "a", "b", "c"
}
```

#### Key points

- Iterates over the keys of an object
- Includes inherited properties
- Not recommended for arrays as it can lead to unexpected results

### `for...of` loop

The `for...of` loop is used to iterate over the values of an iterable object. It works with arrays, strings, maps, sets, and other iterable collections.

```js
const arr = [1, 2, 3];
for (let value of arr) {
  console.log(value); // logs 1, 2, 3
}
```

#### Key points

- Iterates over the values of an iterable object
- Does not include inherited properties
- Ideal for arrays and other iterable collections
