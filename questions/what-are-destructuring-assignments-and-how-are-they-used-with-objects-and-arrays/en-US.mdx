title: What are destructuring assignments and how are they used with objects and arrays?
---

## TL;DR

Destructuring assignments in JavaScript allow you to unpack values from arrays or properties from objects into distinct variables. For arrays, you can extract elements by their position, and for objects, you can extract properties by their names.

For arrays:
```javascript
const [a, b] = [1, 2];
console.log(a); // 1
console.log(b); // 2
```

For objects:
```javascript
const { name, age } = { name: 'John', age: 30 };
console.log(name); // John
console.log(age); // 30
```

## Destructuring assignments

Destructuring assignments in JavaScript provide a convenient way to extract values from arrays and objects into separate variables. This can make your code more readable and concise.

### Destructuring arrays

When destructuring arrays, you can assign elements to variables based on their position in the array.

```javascript
const numbers = [1, 2, 3];
const [first, second, third] = numbers;

console.log(first); // 1
console.log(second); // 2
console.log(third); // 3
```

You can also skip elements by leaving gaps in the assignment:

```javascript
const numbers = [1, 2, 3];
const [first, , third] = numbers;

console.log(first); // 1
console.log(third); // 3
```

### Destructuring objects

When destructuring objects, you can assign properties to variables based on their names.

```javascript
const person = { name: 'John', age: 30 };
const { name, age } = person;

console.log(name); // John
console.log(age); // 30
```

You can also assign properties to variables with different names:

```javascript
const person = { name: 'John', age: 30 };
const { name: personName, age: personAge } = person;

console.log(personName); // John
console.log(personAge); // 30
```

### Nested destructuring

Destructuring can be used with nested objects and arrays as well.

```javascript
const person = {
  name: 'John',
  address: {
    city: 'New York',
    zip: '10001'
  }
};

const { name, address: { city, zip } } = person;

console.log(name); // John
console.log(city); // New York
console.log(zip); // 10001
```

### Default values

You can provide default values in case the property or element does not exist.

```javascript
const person = { name: 'John' };
const { name, age = 25 } = person;

console.log(name); // John
console.log(age); // 25
```

### Function parameters

Destructuring can also be used in function parameters to directly extract values from objects or arrays passed as arguments.

```javascript
function greet({ name, age }) {
  console.log(`Hello, my name is ${name} and I am ${age} years old.`);
}

const person = { name: 'John', age: 30 };
greet(person); // Hello, my name is John and I am 30 years old.
```
