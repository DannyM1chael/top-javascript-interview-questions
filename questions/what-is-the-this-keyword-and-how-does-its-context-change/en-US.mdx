title: What is the `this` keyword and how does its context change?
---

## TL;DR

The `this` keyword in JavaScript refers to the object it belongs to. Its value depends on how a function is called. In a method, `this` refers to the owner object. In a function, `this` refers to the global object (or `undefined` in strict mode). In an event, `this` refers to the element that received the event. Arrow functions do not have their own `this` and inherit it from the parent scope.

```javascript
const obj = {
  method: function() {
    console.log(this); // `this` refers to `obj`
  }
};

function regularFunction() {
  console.log(this); // `this` refers to the global object or `undefined` in strict mode
}

const arrowFunction = () => {
  console.log(this); // `this` refers to the parent scope
};
```

## The `this` keyword and its context

### In a method

When `this` is used inside a method, it refers to the object that owns the method.

```javascript
const person = {
  name: 'Alice',
  greet: function() {
    console.log(this.name); // `this` refers to `person`
  }
};

person.greet(); // Output: Alice
```

### In a function

When `this` is used inside a regular function, it refers to the global object (`window` in browsers) or `undefined` if in strict mode.

```javascript
function showThis() {
  console.log(this); // `this` refers to the global object or `undefined` in strict mode
}

showThis(); // Output: [object Window] or `undefined` in strict mode
```

### In an event

When `this` is used in an event handler, it refers to the element that received the event.

```javascript
document.getElementById('myButton').addEventListener('click', function() {
  console.log(this); // `this` refers to the button element
});
```

### In an arrow function

Arrow functions do not have their own `this`. Instead, they inherit `this` from the parent scope at the time they are defined.

```javascript
const obj = {
  name: 'Alice',
  arrowFunc: () => {
    console.log(this); // `this` refers to the parent scope, not `obj`
  }
};

obj.arrowFunc(); // Output: [object Window] or `undefined` in strict mode
```

### Changing `this` context

You can change the context of `this` using `call`, `apply`, or `bind`.

```javascript
function showName() {
  console.log(this.name);
}

const person = {
  name: 'Alice'
};

showName.call(person); // Output: Alice
```
