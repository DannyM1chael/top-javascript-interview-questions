title: What is the difference between synchronous and asynchronous code?
---

## TL;DR

Synchronous code executes sequentially, meaning each operation must wait for the previous one to complete before it can start. Asynchronous code allows multiple operations to run concurrently, so tasks can start before others finish, improving efficiency and responsiveness. For example, in JavaScript, synchronous code might look like this:

```js
const result = doSomething();
console.log(result);
```

While asynchronous code might use callbacks, promises, or `async/await`:

```js
doSomethingAsync().then((result) => {
  console.log(result);
});
```

## Difference between synchronous and asynchronous code

### Synchronous code

Synchronous code executes in a sequential manner. Each operation waits for the previous one to complete before executing. This can lead to blocking behavior, where a long-running task can prevent subsequent code from running until it finishes.

#### Example

```js
function doSomething() {
  // Simulate a time-consuming task
  for (let i = 0; i < 1e9; i++) {}
  return 'Done';
}

const result = doSomething();
console.log(result); // 'Done' is logged after the function completes
```

### Asynchronous code

Asynchronous code allows multiple operations to run concurrently. This means that tasks can start before others finish, which can improve the efficiency and responsiveness of an application. Asynchronous code in JavaScript can be implemented using callbacks, promises, or `async/await`.

#### Example with callbacks

```js
function doSomethingAsync(callback) {
  setTimeout(() => {
    callback('Done');
  }, 1000);
}

doSomethingAsync((result) => {
  console.log(result); // 'Done' is logged after 1 second
});
```

#### Example with promises

```js
function doSomethingAsync() {
  return new Promise((resolve) => {
    setTimeout(() => {
      resolve('Done');
    }, 1000);
  });
}

doSomethingAsync().then((result) => {
  console.log(result); // 'Done' is logged after 1 second
});
```

#### Example with `async/await`

```js
function doSomethingAsync() {
  return new Promise((resolve) => {
    setTimeout(() => {
      resolve('Done');
    }, 1000);
  });
}

async function main() {
  const result = await doSomethingAsync();
  console.log(result); // 'Done' is logged after 1 second
}

main();
```
