title: What is event bubbling and capturing?
---

## TL;DR

Event bubbling and capturing are two phases of event propagation in the DOM. In event bubbling, the event starts from the target element and bubbles up to the root. In event capturing, the event starts from the root and captures down to the target element. You can control these phases using the `addEventListener` method by setting the third parameter to `true` for capturing or `false` for bubbling.

```javascript
element.addEventListener('click', handler, true); // Capturing phase
element.addEventListener('click', handler, false); // Bubbling phase
```

## What is event bubbling and capturing?

### Event propagation

Event propagation is the process by which an event travels through the DOM tree. It consists of three phases:

1. Capturing phase: The event starts from the root and travels down to the target element.
2. Target phase: The event reaches the target element.
3. Bubbling phase: The event bubbles up from the target element to the root.

### Event capturing

In the capturing phase, also known as "trickling," the event starts from the root of the DOM tree and travels down to the target element. This phase allows parent elements to intercept the event before it reaches the target element.

To listen for events during the capturing phase, you can set the third parameter of the `addEventListener` method to `true`.

```javascript
document.getElementById('child').addEventListener('click', function(event) {
    console.log('Capturing phase');
}, true);
```

### Event bubbling

In the bubbling phase, the event starts from the target element and bubbles up to the root of the DOM tree. This phase allows parent elements to handle the event after it has been processed by the target element.

To listen for events during the bubbling phase, you can set the third parameter of the `addEventListener` method to `false` or omit it, as `false` is the default value.

```javascript
document.getElementById('child').addEventListener('click', function(event) {
    console.log('Bubbling phase');
}, false);
```

### Stopping event propagation

You can stop the event from propagating further by using the `stopPropagation` method. This method can be called during either the capturing or bubbling phase.

```javascript
document.getElementById('child').addEventListener('click', function(event) {
    event.stopPropagation();
    console.log('Event propagation stopped');
}, false);
```
