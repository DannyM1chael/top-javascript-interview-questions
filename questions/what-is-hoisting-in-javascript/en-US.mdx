title: What is hoisting in JavaScript?

## TL;DR

Hoisting in JavaScript is a behavior where variable and function declarations are moved to the top of their containing scope during the compile phase. This means you can use functions and variables before they are declared in the code. However, only the declarations are hoisted, not the initializations. For example:

```javascript
console.log(myVar); // undefined
var myVar = 5;

myFunction(); // "Hello, world!"
function myFunction() {
  console.log("Hello, world!");
}
```

## What is hoisting in JavaScript?

### Variable hoisting

In JavaScript, variable declarations using `var` are hoisted to the top of their containing function or global scope. However, the initialization remains in place. This means that the variable is undefined until the line where it is initialized is executed.

```javascript
console.log(myVar); // undefined
var myVar = 5;
console.log(myVar); // 5
```

Variables declared with `let` and `const` are also hoisted but are not initialized. They are in a "temporal dead zone" from the start of the block until the declaration is encountered.

```javascript
console.log(myLet); // ReferenceError: Cannot access 'myLet' before initialization
let myLet = 10;
```

### Function hoisting

Function declarations are fully hoisted, meaning both the function name and the function body are moved to the top of their containing scope. This allows you to call the function before its declaration in the code.

```javascript
myFunction(); // "Hello, world!"
function myFunction() {
  console.log("Hello, world!");
}
```

Function expressions, including those using `var`, `let`, or `const`, are not hoisted in the same way. Only the variable declaration is hoisted, not the function assignment.

```javascript
myFunction(); // TypeError: myFunction is not a function
var myFunction = function() {
  console.log("Hello, world!");
};
```

### Class hoisting

Classes in JavaScript are not hoisted. Trying to use a class before it is declared will result in a `ReferenceError`.

```javascript
const instance = new MyClass(); // ReferenceError: Cannot access 'MyClass' before initialization
class MyClass {}
```
