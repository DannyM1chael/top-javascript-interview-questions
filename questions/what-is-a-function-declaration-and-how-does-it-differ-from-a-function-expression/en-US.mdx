title: What is a function declaration and how does it differ from a function expression?
---

## TL;DR

A function declaration defines a named function and is hoisted, meaning it can be called before it is defined in the code. A function expression defines a function as part of an expression and is not hoisted, so it cannot be called before it is defined.

```js
// Function declaration
function greet() {
  console.log('Hello!');
}

// Function expression
const greet = function () {
  console.log('Hello!');
};
```

## Function declaration vs function expression

### Function declaration

A function declaration defines a named function. It is hoisted to the top of its scope, meaning you can call the function before it is defined in the code.

```js
// Function declaration
function greet() {
  console.log('Hello!');
}

greet(); // Output: Hello!
```

### Function expression

A function expression defines a function as part of an expression. It can be anonymous or named, but it is not hoisted, so it cannot be called before it is defined.

```js
// Function expression
const greet = function () {
  console.log('Hello!');
};

greet(); // Output: Hello!
```

### Key differences

- **Hoisting**: Function declarations are hoisted, while function expressions are not.
- **Syntax**: Function declarations use the `function` keyword followed by the function name, while function expressions can be assigned to variables.
- **Usage**: Function declarations are useful for defining functions that need to be available throughout the scope, while function expressions are useful for defining functions in a more flexible and modular way.
