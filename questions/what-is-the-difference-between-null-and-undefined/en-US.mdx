title: What is the difference between `null` and `undefined`?
---

## TL;DR

`null` is an assignment value that represents the intentional absence of any object value. It is explicitly set by the programmer. `undefined` means a variable has been declared but has not yet been assigned a value. It is the default value for uninitialized variables.

```js
let a;
console.log(a); // undefined

let b = null;
console.log(b); // null
```

## Difference between `null` and `undefined`

### Definition

- `null`: It is an assignment value that represents the intentional absence of any object value. It is explicitly set by the programmer.
- `undefined`: It means a variable has been declared but has not yet been assigned a value. It is the default value for uninitialized variables.

### Type

- `null`: It is of type `object`.
  ```js
  console.log(typeof null); // "object"
  ```
- `undefined`: It is of type `undefined`.
  ```js
  console.log(typeof undefined); // "undefined"
  ```

### Usage

- `null`: Used to explicitly indicate "no value".
  ```js
  let user = null; // user is explicitly set to have no value
  ```
- `undefined`: Used to indicate that a variable has been declared but not yet assigned a value.
  ```js
  let user;
  console.log(user); // undefined
  ```

### Comparison

- `null` vs `undefined`:
  ```js
  console.log(null == undefined); // true
  console.log(null === undefined); // false
  ```

### Common scenarios

- `null`:
  - When you want to reset or clear a variable.
    ```js
    let data = { name: 'John' };
    data = null; // data is now explicitly set to have no value
    ```
- `undefined`:
  - When a variable is declared but not initialized.
    ```js
    let data;
    console.log(data); // undefined
    ```
