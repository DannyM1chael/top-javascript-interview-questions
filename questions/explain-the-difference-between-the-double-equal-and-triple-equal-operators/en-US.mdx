title: Explain the difference between the `==` and `===` operators
---

## TL;DR

The `==` operator checks for equality with type coercion, meaning it converts the operands to the same type before making the comparison. The `===` operator checks for strict equality without type coercion, meaning both the value and the type must be the same for the comparison to return true. For example, `5 == '5'` returns true, but `5 === '5'` returns false.

## Difference between the `==` and `===` operators

### Type coercion

The `==` operator performs type coercion, which means it converts the operands to the same type before making the comparison. This can lead to unexpected results if you're not careful.

```js
console.log(5 == '5'); // true
console.log(true == 1); // true
console.log(null == undefined); // true
```

### Strict equality

The `===` operator, on the other hand, does not perform type coercion. It checks for both value and type equality. This makes it a safer choice for comparisons in most cases.

```js
console.log(5 === '5'); // false
console.log(true === 1); // false
console.log(null === undefined); // false
```

### Use cases

- Use `==` when you want to compare values regardless of their type, but be cautious of unexpected type coercion.
- Use `===` when you want to ensure both the value and type are the same, which is generally recommended for most comparisons to avoid bugs.

### Common pitfalls

- Comparing `null` and `undefined` with `==` returns true, but with `===` it returns false.
- Comparing different types with `==` can lead to unexpected results due to type coercion.

```js
console.log(null == undefined); // true
console.log(null === undefined); // false
console.log('' == 0); // true
console.log('' === 0); // false
```
