title: Explain the concept of prototypal inheritance in JavaScript.
---

## TL;DR

Prototypal inheritance in JavaScript is a feature that allows objects to inherit properties and methods from other objects. This is achieved through the prototype chain, where an object can have a prototype object, and that prototype object can have its own prototype, and so on. This chain allows for property and method sharing across objects. For example:

```js
const parent = {
  greet() {
    console.log('Hello');
  },
};

const child = Object.create(parent);
child.greet(); // Outputs: Hello
```

## Prototypal inheritance in JavaScript

Prototypal inheritance is a core feature of JavaScript that allows objects to inherit properties and methods from other objects. This is different from classical inheritance found in languages like Java or C++, where classes inherit from other classes.

### The prototype chain

In JavaScript, every object has a special property called `__proto__` (or `[[Prototype]]` in the specification) that points to another object, known as its prototype. This creates a chain of objects, known as the prototype chain. When you try to access a property or method on an object, JavaScript will first look for it on the object itself. If it doesn't find it, it will look for it on the object's prototype, and so on, until it reaches the end of the chain (usually `null`).

### Creating objects with prototypes

You can create an object with a specific prototype using `Object.create()`:

```js
const parent = {
  greet() {
    console.log('Hello');
  },
};

const child = Object.create(parent);
child.greet(); // Outputs: Hello
```

In this example, `child` inherits the `greet` method from `parent`.

### Constructor functions and `prototype`

Another way to set up prototypal inheritance is by using constructor functions and the `prototype` property:

```js
function Person(name) {
  this.name = name;
}

Person.prototype.greet = function () {
  console.log(`Hello, my name is ${this.name}`);
};

const alice = new Person('Alice');
alice.greet(); // Outputs: Hello, my name is Alice
```

Here, the `greet` method is defined on `Person.prototype`, so all instances of `Person` will inherit this method.

### ES6 classes

ES6 introduced the `class` syntax, which provides a more familiar way to work with prototypal inheritance, but under the hood, it still uses prototypes:

```js
class Person {
  constructor(name) {
    this.name = name;
  }

  greet() {
    console.log(`Hello, my name is ${this.name}`);
  }
}

const bob = new Person('Bob');
bob.greet(); // Outputs: Hello, my name is Bob
```

### Advantages of prototypal inheritance

- **Flexibility**: Objects can inherit from other objects directly, without the need for classes.
- **Efficiency**: Shared properties and methods are stored in a single location (the prototype), saving memory.

### Disadvantages of prototypal inheritance

- **Complexity**: The prototype chain can be difficult to understand and debug, especially for developers coming from class-based languages.
- **Performance**: Deep prototype chains can lead to slower property lookups.
