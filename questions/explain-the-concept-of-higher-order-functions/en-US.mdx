title: Explain the concept of higher-order functions.
---

## TL;DR

Higher-order functions are functions that can take other functions as arguments or return them as results. They are a key feature of JavaScript and enable powerful programming patterns like callbacks, function composition, and currying. For example, `Array.prototype.map` is a higher-order function because it takes a function as an argument and applies it to each element in the array.

```js
const numbers = [1, 2, 3];
const doubled = numbers.map((num) => num * 2); // [2, 4, 6]
```

## Higher-order functions

Higher-order functions are a fundamental concept in functional programming and are widely used in JavaScript. They provide a way to abstract and compose behavior, making code more modular and reusable.

### Definition

A higher-order function is a function that either:

- Takes one or more functions as arguments
- Returns a function as its result

### Examples

#### Array methods

Many of the built-in array methods in JavaScript are higher-order functions. For example:

- `Array.prototype.map`: Takes a function as an argument and applies it to each element in the array.

  ```js
  const numbers = [1, 2, 3];
  const doubled = numbers.map((num) => num * 2); // [2, 4, 6]
  ```

- `Array.prototype.filter`: Takes a function as an argument and returns a new array with elements that pass the test implemented by the provided function.

  ```js
  const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4];
  const even = numbers.filter((num) => num % 2 === 0); // [2, 4]
  ```

- `Array.prototype.reduce`: Takes a function as an argument and applies it against an accumulator and each element in the array to reduce it to a single value.

  ```js
  const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4];
  const sum = numbers.reduce((acc, num) => acc + num, 0); // 10
  ```

#### Function returning another function

A higher-order function can also return another function. This is useful for creating function factories or for currying.

- Function factory example:

  ```js
  function createMultiplier(multiplier) {
    return function (num) {
      return num * multiplier;
    };
  }

  const double = createMultiplier(2);
  console.log(double(5)); // 10
  ```

- Currying example:

  ```js
  function add(a) {
    return function (b) {
      return a + b;
    };
  }

  const addFive = add(5);
  console.log(addFive(3)); // 8
  ```

### Benefits

- **Modularity**: Higher-order functions help in breaking down complex problems into smaller, reusable functions.
- **Abstraction**: They allow for abstracting common patterns, making the code more readable and maintainable.
- **Composition**: They enable function composition, where small functions are combined to build more complex functions.
