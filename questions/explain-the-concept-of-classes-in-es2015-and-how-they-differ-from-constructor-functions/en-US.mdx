title: Explain the concept of classes in ES2015 and how they differ from constructor functions.
---

## TL;DR

In ES2015, classes provide a more intuitive and cleaner syntax for creating objects and handling inheritance compared to constructor functions. Classes use the `class` keyword and include methods like `constructor` for initialization. Unlike constructor functions, classes support inheritance using the `extends` keyword and the `super` function to call parent class methods.

```javascript
class Animal {
  constructor(name) {
    this.name = name;
  }

  speak() {
    console.log(`${this.name} makes a noise.`);
  }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
  speak() {
    console.log(`${this.name} barks.`);
  }
}

const dog = new Dog('Rex');
dog.speak(); // Rex barks.
```

## Classes in ES2015

### Introduction to classes

Classes in ES2015 (also known as ES6) provide a new syntax for creating objects and handling inheritance. They are syntactic sugar over JavaScript's existing prototype-based inheritance, making it easier to understand and work with.

### Defining a class

A class is defined using the `class` keyword followed by the class name. Inside the class, you can define a `constructor` method for initializing objects and other methods for behavior.

```javascript
class Animal {
  constructor(name) {
    this.name = name;
  }

  speak() {
    console.log(`${this.name} makes a noise.`);
  }
}
```

### Creating an instance

You can create an instance of a class using the `new` keyword.

```javascript
const animal = new Animal('Lion');
animal.speak(); // Lion makes a noise.
```

### Inheritance

Classes support inheritance using the `extends` keyword. The `super` function is used to call the parent class's constructor and methods.

```javascript
class Dog extends Animal {
  speak() {
    console.log(`${this.name} barks.`);
  }
}

const dog = new Dog('Rex');
dog.speak(); // Rex barks.
```

## Constructor functions

### Introduction to constructor functions

Before ES2015, constructor functions were used to create objects and handle inheritance. A constructor function is a regular function that is used with the `new` keyword to create an instance.

### Defining a constructor function

A constructor function is defined like any other function but is intended to be used with the `new` keyword.

```javascript
function Animal(name) {
  this.name = name;
}

Animal.prototype.speak = function() {
  console.log(`${this.name} makes a noise.`);
};
```

### Creating an instance

You can create an instance of a constructor function using the `new` keyword.

```javascript
const animal = new Animal('Lion');
animal.speak(); // Lion makes a noise.
```

### Inheritance

Inheritance in constructor functions is achieved using `Object.create` and manually setting the prototype chain.

```javascript
function Dog(name) {
  Animal.call(this, name);
}

Dog.prototype = Object.create(Animal.prototype);
Dog.prototype.constructor = Dog;

Dog.prototype.speak = function() {
  console.log(`${this.name} barks.`);
};

const dog = new Dog('Rex');
dog.speak(); // Rex barks.
```

## Differences between classes and constructor functions

### Syntax

- Classes use the `class` keyword and have a cleaner, more intuitive syntax.
- Constructor functions are regular functions used with the `new` keyword.

### Inheritance

- Classes use the `extends` keyword and `super` function for inheritance.
- Constructor functions use `Object.create` and manually set the prototype chain.

### Method definitions

- In classes, methods are defined directly within the class body.
- In constructor functions, methods are added to the prototype.
